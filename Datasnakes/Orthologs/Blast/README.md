Blast Documentation
=====================
Use [NCBI's standalone blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) 
to generate blastn results.


What is BLAST?
----------------
Per NCBI, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local 
similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein 
sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of 
matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships 
between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families. 

NCBI's BLASTN programs search nucleotide databases using a nucleotide query.

Usage
-----
