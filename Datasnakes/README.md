Datasnakes Mini-Tutorial
========================
Datasnakes has been built with Python3.6 as a pipeline framework for current
(comparative genetics for orthologs), and furute (RNA-seq) bioinformatic data analysis.
Currently, this python package is comprised of 4 major modules:
1.  Cookies - Deploys directory structures using cookiecutter.
2.  Manager - Pipeline configuration and management.
3.  Tools - Established and developed utility tools.
4.  Orthologs - Pipeline generation for comparative genetics.

When used together, these 4 modules offer a cohesive environment for easily creating,
managing, and deploying a bioinformatics pipeline for orthologous genes/species.  In the future
these tools will also be accessible from the command line and from a web application.

READMEs are provided in each module's directory, but we've compiled a mini tutorial here
that can inform users on how to use these modules.

Using the Cookies module
------------------------
#### Overview
The Cookies module acts as a repository for custom [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) templates.  

Each "Cookie" allows us to quickly create and deploy different projects with various directory structures.  They are meant to help organize projects
and data in a standardized way.  This module is used almost extensively by the Manager module.

In the context of the Manager module the Cookie class is used to deploy an entire repository geared towards developing a web-page using Flask and R-Shiny.
Cookies can also be used to create standalone projects that don't require an entire repository.

#### TODO - After creating a cookie class, add real examples here.
#### Examples
Templates used when creating a full repository:
* _Cookies/new_repository_
* _Cookies/new_user_
* _Cookies/new_project_
* _Cookies/new_research_
* _Cookies/new_database_ (for NCBI, proprietary, etc. databases)
* _Cookies/new_app_ (for [R-Shiny](https://github.com/grabear/awesome-rshiny) applications)
* _Cookies/new_website_ (for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) applications)

**Template for standalone projects**
* _Cookies/new_basic_project_

Using Manager
--------------
#### Overview
The Manager module uses the Cookie class in order to deploy a bioinformatics repository
with an organized directory structure based on specific users and the projects that they create.
Pipeline customization and configuration will also be possible through YAML files.

#### Future Direction
First, a database_management class for dealing with the various databases (NCBI, BioSQL, etc.) will be developed.
Then the Management class will become responsible for functioning alongside Flask in order to create a web interface.
The web interface will give each user access to the Tools and Orthologs modules as well as data generated by the pipeline functionality.

#### Examples
```python
from Datasnakes.Manager.management import Management
from Datasnakes.Manager.management import RepoManagement
from Datasnakes.Manager.management import UserManagemnt
from Datasnakes.Manager.management import WebsiteManagement
from Datasnakes.Manager.management import ProjectManagement
```
Using Orthologs
----------------
#### What is Orthologs?

#### Why Orthologs?

#### Examples
    - Blast - Classes for our very specific NCBI-BLAST needs.  (Gathering Accessions)
    - GenBank - Class for handling GenBank, BioSQL, and FASTA sequences.
    - Alignment - Class for using various Sequence aligners.
    - Phylogenetics - Class for doing phylogenetic analysis
