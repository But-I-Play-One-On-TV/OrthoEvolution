Datasnakes Mini-Tutorial
==========================
Presently, this package is comprised of 4 major modules: Cookies, Manager, Orthologs,
and Tools. These 4 modules combine to offer a cohesive environment for easily creating,
managing, and deploying a data analysis pipeline of orthologous genes/species.

Additionally, this pipeline provides a way to easily visualize data, create/maintain project
structure, and edit structure/analysis tools to fit needs.

READMEs are provided in each module's directory, but we've compiled a mini tutorial here
that can inform users on how to use these modules.
