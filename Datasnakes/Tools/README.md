Tools
========
These tools were created by or modified our team to aid with the Orthologs package.

We've incorporated tools for bash with pybasher, qsub tools for use with pbs, a pandoc
script for converting docx files to markdown formats, multiprocessing in multiprocess, and
a ftp module that aids in downloading files from NCBI's ftp repository.


Usage
-----

Import this module if you want to use the tools within it.
``` python
import Tools.pybasher
```
or
``` python
import Tools
```
or

``` python
from Tools import qsub
```

#### Code Examples
