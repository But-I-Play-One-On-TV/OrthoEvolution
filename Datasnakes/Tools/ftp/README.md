FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Documentation
-------------------------
The `ftp` module is geared towards making it easier to interface with [NCBI's
FTP repository](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

More specifically, we provide a way to easily find and list directories and their
respective contents as well as to download blast databases and other databases
for use with the Orthologs package.

Usage
-----

These tools are optimized to be used together (very little work to do that), but can also be used singularly.


#### Simple Example

This is a simple example of using some of the modules.

``` python
from Tools import ftp

```

Tests
-----

Tests will be added soon.
