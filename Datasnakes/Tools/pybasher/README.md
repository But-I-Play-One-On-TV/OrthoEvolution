Background
----------
While learning to use a Linux/Unix shell with Python, I realized that Python's native shell modules are often clunkier and more difficult to use than simply using the Bash shell. That lead me to start using `os.system` although I realized that `subprocess.call` gave me more control of standard output. This module/package will seek to simplify a number of useful bash commands & make them easier to incorporate into python scripts. 


Install/Setup
---------------

This package depends upon a knowledge of [Python]() and [Linux]().


Usage
-----

Place code examples here and other ways to use this project/pipeline.
