# Pipeline Documentation

The Pipeline module is designed to provide the user with easily callable and
command line usable pipelines that allow orthology inference to be completed
in a parallel fashion and with a one line command.

Soon, there will be many preconfigured pipelines that you can run if you are using a
cluster (**specifically one that uses pbspro or sun grid engine**) and also preconfigured
snakemake pipelines.


## Examples


### Running a Blast Pipeline

``` python
```

## Software Dependencies
Ensure that you have at least pbs version `14.1.0` if you are using the SGE pipelines.
