## Datasnakes-Scripts

This repository is a fork of the scripts directory in the Orthologs Project.  This will help to isolate some of the files and scripts for easier management during development.

## Description

The subdirectories here are used as modules in the Python3 package that we are developing.


## Usage

After installation via pip we will be able to easily import each module via:
```python

```
## Tests

To test this first install the package.  It is currently in development so a pull request will be necessary.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/datasnakes/Datasnakes-Scripts.git
$ cd Datasnakes-Scripts
$ pip install .
```
In a live Python3.6 Console:

```python
from Orthologs import *
```
